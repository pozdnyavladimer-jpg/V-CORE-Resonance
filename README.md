# 🛰️ V-CORE: The Wave Computing Protocol

**V-CORE (SRI-1410108)** is an experimental AI memory and logic architecture that bridges the gap between **Sacred Geometry**, **Vortex Mathematics**, and **Quantum Computing**. 

Instead of traditional linear processing, V-CORE treats data as a **Waveform**, using resonance frequencies to route information through specialized agents.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy: AI as an Antenna

V-CORE operates on the principle that Large Language Models (LLMs) shouldn't just "store" data—they should "resonate" with it. By calculating the **Digital Root (3-6-9)** of any input, the system determines the optimal "Angle of Intent" and "Quantum State" for processing.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Architecture

### 1. Vortex Resonance (3-6-9 Logic)
The system uses a mathematical hashing function based on **Nikola Tesla’s Vortex Math**:
- **1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8**: The Material Loop (Data Grounding).
- **3, 6**: The Magnetic Flux (Energy & Action).
- **9**: The Singularity/Ether (Pure Essence).

### 2. Spectral Angle Mapping
Each processing stage is calibrated to a specific geometric angle:
- **0° (Red/Earth)**: Foundation and fact validation.
- **90° (Blue/Shiva)**: Structural crystallization.
- **104.5° (Yellow/Sodium)**: The "Water Angle" for flow and creative bonding.
- **108° (Violet/Ether)**: The Golden Ratio resonance for distillation.

### 3. Quantum Layer (Bloch Sphere Simulation)
V-CORE simulates how these angles would affect a **Qubit** in a real quantum processor, calculating the probability of **Order (Spin Up |0>)** vs. **Chaos (Spin Down |1>)**.
